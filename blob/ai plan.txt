ai plan

each blob is controlled by an ai who will fight for the color that the blob is currently controlled by.
instead of calling a color that will then choose a blob to fire every so often instead a function is called
by each ai blob in the scene. I think it would be best to loop through each blob in the scene every x 
loops through or maybe just cycle through the blobs as the for loop progresses. 

regardless of what you choose the following behavior should be ensured by the function:

first of all, is there an attack coming to me?
	yes - how far away is it?
			far - continue.
			close - deadly?
					yes - attack lowest health blob on another team.
					no - return.

am I at the threshold to attack?
	yes - are there any neutral blobs?
		yes - attack the lowest one.
		no - attack players then attack other ai.

can I take over any blobs?
	*consider distance from current blob to account for growing?*
	yes - attack.

return.
